# vega-lite-codes
I came to know about VegaLite at a workshop of [Dr. Kate Isaacs](http://hdc.cs.arizona.edu/people/kisaacs/)(my supervisor) at University of Arizona. It seems very cool and interesting. We can do a lot of things using VegaLite with very less effort. It's very easy to use and understand.
